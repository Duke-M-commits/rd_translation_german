	"MailBody1A"	"Dr. Da Silva, my research demands of me that I maintain precision to near surgical degrees. And with that, quite befittingly in fact, proper focus. ‘Proper’ as in not being continually interrupted with trivial concerns."
	"MailBody1B"	"While I do appreciate the tremendous aid provided thus far by your assistants, the ongoing operations - of which I am in charge by virtue of my attributions as this mission’s Chief Scientist - will summarily conclude if everyone finally agrees to leave me to my work."
	"MailBody1C"	"Thank you."

	"MailBody3B"	"At your request, I have shifted the biology team’s efforts to general research; the subjects from our most recent discovery have also been transferred to your personal laboratories. May I, however, ask you the reasoning behind this decision?"
	"MailBody3C"	"Yours sincerely,"
	"MailBody3D"	"Dr. Lin Da Silva"
