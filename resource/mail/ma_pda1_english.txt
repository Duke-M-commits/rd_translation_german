"MailFrom1"		"From: Nicholas Gray"
"MailDate1"		"Date: 11/22/28"
"MailSubject1"	"Subject: SynTek at it again"
"MailBody1A"	"This time SynTek are requesting the interstellar coordinates for the volcano zone. For some reason that zone in particular has piqued their interest. Have they never seen a volcano? A lot of planets have them."
"MailBody1B"	"Anyway I'm sure it's nothing, though it's strange why is SynTek trying to get involved in this operation."
"MailBody1C"	"And one more thing, before we open the academy for public use, they are requesting to diagnose our teleporters to make sure that they are consciousness-preserving. Have to give it to them, that's a valid concern. Wouldn't want to go through those teleporters myself before I know they're safe."

"MailFrom2"		"From: Brian Howe"
"MailDate2"		"Date: 02/15/29"
"MailSubject2"	"Subject: Re: Requesting Zone 3 Closure"
"MailBody2A"	"Sorry for the late response Mr. Savage"
"MailBody2B"	"On behalf of SynTek, we are terribly sorry for the loss of your marines. Zone 3 has been closed."
"MailBody2C"	"Regarding your proposed alternative, we disagree - void dimension is extremely hard to access and will require expensive teleporters. Besides, marines might get distracted in that dimension, if you know what we mean."
"MailBody2D"	"          - Message forwarded from [SynTek] by [Brian Howe]"

"MailFrom3"		"To: SynTek"
"MailDate3"		"Date: 01/10/29"
"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Requesting Zone 3 Closure"
"MailBody3A"	"Tester group 3 has reported a zone 3 collapse due to asteroid impact."
"MailBody3B"	"Possible cause: heavy material usage diverted the space ship trajectory."
"MailBody3C"	"Possible replacement: the void dimension."
