Mature Content:

The main gameplay loop is using weapons to kill alien bugs. Aliens explode into blood and gore when killed. Bloodied human corpses can be found in some missions, but there is no human dismemberment.
Profanity such as "shit" is used in voiced dialogue.
Photosensitivity warning: There are some community-made missions that use a strobe light effect.
