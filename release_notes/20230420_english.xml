Here are some highlights from updates since the previous anniversary:
[list]
[*]Workshop addons can now contain videos, and missions can define their own briefing background video, or even show part of the world as the background during briefing.
[*]We're Steam Deck verified! The game runs great on the Steam Deck, and players on Linux or who use a controller have also seen improvements.
[*]There are now medals you can earn by helping with the game's development, contributing to the Steam community hub, or participating in a season of Heroes of the Interstellar Armed Forces.
[*]The slow-opening vault doors used in many missions now have more accurate collision data, allowing you to step or shoot through a partially-opened door.
[*]The all-new mission selection screen includes support for bonus missions and new "endless" missions.
[*]We've added an advanced settings menu and an advanced audio settings menu.
[*]Restarting a mission no longer requires a loading screen.
